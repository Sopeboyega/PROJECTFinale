Problems to be solved
+ Main menu needs to have register,login or exit as user (Do not worry about admin.)
+ Admin needs to have special username and passkey that redirects him to his menu 
+ Why does our checkout clear the whole populated struct. ?
+ Also user actions should affect directly a retrived file and write a new file to the inventory..
+ Add feedback menu to the user section.
+ When updating the inventory the admin should use a function that gets the whole products in a struct 
and then update the selected products and write the newly updated structs in the file

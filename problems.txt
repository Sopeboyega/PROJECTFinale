Problems to be solved
+ Main menu needs to have register,login or exit as user (Do not worry about admin.)
+ Admin needs to have special username and passkey that redirects him to his menu 
+ Why does our checkout clear the whole populated struct. ?
+ Also user actions should affect directly the inventory not the populated struct.
+ I dont think they would be need for structs again.
+ Add feedback menu to the user section.
